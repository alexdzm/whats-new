Dream Bags Jaguar Shoes + The Victoria,https://www.jaguarshoes.com/events/,"The original East London Arts collective, we create beautiful and unique exhibitions, events, merchandise, prints, media content and publications. The organisation was born out of much celebrated Shoreditch bar and exhibition space Dream Bags Jaguar Shoes in London in 2001.
The unusual name of this founding business is derived from the two 1980s bag and shoe wholesaler signs that hang on the buildings original shop front."
The Troubadour,https://www.troubadourlondon.com/ticketed-events,"The Troubadour proudly follows the path laid before us by our predecessors who helped shaped the London music scene and pop-culture on a global level.
In the late 50's and early 60's, we became the epicentre for
the
British folk revival
and
were the first place Bob Dylan ever played in the U.K. The genre of music was so popular at the time that a young Paul Simon
moved
to London so that he could immerse himself in the scene and culture, and of course played at the Troubadour.
Along with folk, the Troubadour also became a prominent venue in the Jazz music scene and was a London go-to for Jazz. And in that time we had some of Britains finest jazz musicians frequent our stage: Charlie Watts, Lionel Grigson, Michael ""Spike"" Wells, Mick Pyne, Dave Gelly MBE, Daryl Runswick and David ""Happy"" Williams all played here.
​
We're very proud of our jazz heritage
and still host weekly jazz nights! Find out more
here
.
​
Another famous
American
transplant by the name of Jimi Hendrix also
played
and frequented the floorboards of our stage whilst he lived in London. And during the height of their fever
and
fervour, after playing sold-out shows at the Earls Court Exhibition Centre, Robert Plant and Jimmy Page of Led Zeppelin would often come back to the Troubadour and jam into the early mornings.
In more recent years we have been fortunate enough to remain a part of London's music culture and play a part in the early careers of modern hero's like Adele, Ed Sheeran and Paolo Nutini.
So, get your tickets to one of
our
upcoming events because you never now who
you might see, and who might be climbing into the pages of the history books next!
