{"URL": "https://www.troubadourlondon.com/ticketed-events", "content": "The Troubadour proudly follows the path laid before us by our predecessors who helped shaped the London music scene and pop-culture on a global level.\nIn the late 50's and early 60's, we became the epicentre for\nthe\nBritish folk revival\nand\nwere the first place Bob Dylan ever played in the U.K. The genre of music was so popular at the time that a young Paul Simon\nmoved\nto London so that he could immerse himself in the scene and culture, and of course played at the Troubadour.\nAlong with folk, the Troubadour also became a prominent venue in the Jazz music scene and was a London go-to for Jazz. And in that time we had some of Britains finest jazz musicians frequent our stage: Charlie Watts, Lionel Grigson, Michael \"Spike\" Wells, Mick Pyne, Dave Gelly MBE, Daryl Runswick and David \"Happy\" Williams all played here.\n\u200b\nWe're very proud of our jazz heritage\nand still host weekly jazz nights! Find out more\nhere\n.\n\u200b\nAnother famous\nAmerican\ntransplant by the name of Jimi Hendrix also\nplayed\nand frequented the floorboards of our stage whilst he lived in London. And during the height of their fever\nand\nfervour, after playing sold-out shows at the Earls Court Exhibition Centre, Robert Plant and Jimmy Page of Led Zeppelin would often come back to the Troubadour and jam into the early mornings.\nIn more recent years we have been fortunate enough to remain a part of London's music culture and play a part in the early careers of modern hero's like Adele, Ed Sheeran and Paolo Nutini.\nSo, get your tickets to one of\nour\nupcoming events because you never now who\nyou might see, and who might be climbing into the pages of the history books next!\n\u200b\nYou can read more about our rich history by following the link below."}
